# Module 2: Creating a Data Lake storage account

We will need to create a place to store all the data we will be getting from the external API. We selected **Azure Data Lake** to integrate all the components in the architecture as it is optimized for analytics, rather than using a Blob Storage which is more of a general purpose bulk storage.

To create a Data Lake storage you can follow these steps:

1. In the **Azure Portal** click on the **Create a resource** button.

# Summing up

At this point we have created our ADF service and the storage account where we will store the data coming from the Football API. In the following articles we will show you how to create the pipeline, how to read the data we get from the API, and how to transform it and save it into our Data Lake storage.
